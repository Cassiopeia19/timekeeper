# timekeeper
This was something that I had created while working on a daycare CRM in my Information Systems Capstone.  This would have coincided with the various children's names.  It auto-populates the date, and upon clicking 'clock-in' or 'clock-out', the current time is then populated.  'Submit times' will clear out the times (we were going to have the times clicked populate the database whenever the user were to click 'submit times').
