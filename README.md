# timekeeper
This was something that I had created while working on a daycare CRM.  This would have coincided with the various children's names.  It auto-populates the date, and upon clicking 'clock-in' or 'clock-out', the current time is then populated.  Submit times will clear out the times (we were going to have the times clicked populate the database at this time).
